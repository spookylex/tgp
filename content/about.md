Bienvenue! The Guillemets Project is designed by Spyridon Simotas and Alexis Osipovs at the University of Virginia. Our project is exploring how online real-life technology impacts French language learning. One of our primary objectives is to emphasize the importance and benefits of learning French, as well as any other world language, and to engage with students through various creative media.
